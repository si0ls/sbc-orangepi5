# sbc-orangepi5

This repository contains the overlay for the Orange Pi 5 Talos

## Upstream dependencies

This repo uses upstream dependencies that are not in sync with the last Talos version.

- u-boot: [v2024.04-rc4](https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/tags/v2024.04-rc4) (without patches)
- kernel: [v6.8](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tag/?h=v6.8) (with some patches)

The best effort is made to keep the overlay in sync with the upstream dependencies.
This repository will be updated as soon as the new versions are available.
